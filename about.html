          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I spent nearly 20 years as an electronics technician before making a deliberate career transition
            into cybersecurity — earning a <strong style="color:#fff">Master's degree in SCADA cybersecurity</strong>
            and bringing a hardware-first perspective that most practitioners simply don't have. My work sits
            at the intersection of physical-layer security and critical infrastructure defense, approaching
            ICS/OT security from the sensor up, not just the network down.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the author of the <strong style="color:#fff">"Inputs Lie"</strong> research framework, I investigate how
            deterministic logic in SCADA and ICS environments can be manipulated through physical-layer signal
            drift, GNSS timing manipulation, and unverified external inputs. My research addresses a structural
            blind spot in current security frameworks: critical infrastructure systems implicitly trust external
            signals that can be manipulated below traditional detection thresholds by patient, sophisticated adversaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Professionally, I currently serve as a <strong style="color:#fff">Technical Lead for Identity and
            Access Management</strong> in the financial sector — applying rigorous security discipline in one
            of the most heavily regulated industries in the world, while continuing independent research on
            ICS/OT and physical-layer threats.
          </p>

            <h2>Research &amp; Community</h2>
            <p>
              I am an active contributor to the ICS security community, presenting research on the convergence
              of SIGINT, satellite cybersecurity, and ICS/OT security. I presented <em>"When Cyber Meets the
              Spectrum"</em> at <strong style="color:#fff">BSides Delaware</strong> and serve as a long-term
              organizer and volunteer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current research targets conference submission to the
              <strong style="color:#fff">ICS Cyber Security Conference</strong> and
              <strong style="color:#fff">S4</strong>, focusing on GNSS timing manipulation as an attack vector
              against critical infrastructure control systems.
