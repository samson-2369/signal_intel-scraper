          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I am a cybersecurity researcher and practitioner with nearly 20 years of hands-on experience
            in electronics and industrial systems. My work sits at the intersection of physical-layer security
            and critical infrastructure defense — approaching ICS/OT security from the sensor up, not just
            the network down.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the author of the <strong style="color:#fff">"Inputs Lie"</strong> research framework, I investigate how
            deterministic logic in SCADA and ICS environments can be manipulated through physical-layer signal
            drift, GNSS timing manipulation, and unverified external inputs. My research addresses a structural
            blind spot in current security frameworks: critical infrastructure systems implicitly trust external
            signals that can be manipulated below traditional detection thresholds by patient, sophisticated adversaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond research, I have served as a technical lead for Identity and Access Management programs in
            regulated financial and critical infrastructure-adjacent environments, bridging the gap between
            security operations and policy compliance.
          </p>

            <h2>Research &amp; Community</h2>
            <p>
              I am an active contributor to the ICS security community, presenting research on the convergence
              of SIGINT, satellite cybersecurity, and ICS/OT security. I presented <em>"When Cyber Meets the
              Spectrum"</em> at <strong style="color:#fff">BSides Delaware</strong> and serve as a long-term
              organizer and volunteer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current research targets conference submission to the
              <strong style="color:#fff">ICS Cyber Security Conference</strong> and
              <strong style="color:#fff">S4</strong>, focusing on GNSS timing manipulation as an attack vector
              against critical infrastructure control systems.
